                    The first records of this game were found in the Egyptian
                    pyramids, about 7 thousand years old. Ancient Egyptian
                    drawings show that the most avid players were African
                    traders, who spent not a little free time playing the game
                    while waiting for their cargoes or during long journeys.
                    Thousands of years ago this game left the African continent
                    and spread to Asia, the Caribbean, South America and Europe.
                    The most characteristic element of mankala games is the
                    acquisition of stones. In the Kyrgyz version of this game -
                    toguz korgool, the player's goal is also to acquire as many
                    korgools as possible.

                    - A fragment of a found stone board Toguz Korgool, dating
                    back to the 4th century BC, is kept in a museum in Scotland.
                    The game was originally intended for military training,
                    because in order to control the troops, it is necessary to
                    educate the mind from early childhood. Did you know that, in
                    military schools in Japan and China, a compulsory subject of
                    "strategic games" was introduced. An example of this is one
                    of the oldest known among board games "Go".

                    - According to Asanbek Askarov, a local resident of the
                    village of Kara-Tobo in Aksy district in Kyrgyzstan, there
                    is a large stone in the Kazan-Tabak cave with traces of
                    "toguz korgool". Such traces of "Toguz Korgool" are not on
                    one stone, but on 12.

                    - Connoisseurs of Toguz Korgool sometimes compare this game
                    with chess. If chess is geometry, diagonals, then toguz
                    korgool is pure arithmetic, where you need to be able to
                    count. In chess you can get more than 50 million positions
                    in one second on a super-modern computer. In toguz korgool
                    the computer will think 27 minutes for six moves ahead,
                    three years for 7 moves ahead, and forever for 8 moves
                    ahead. It is very difficult to calculate the options, but a
                    human has the method of elimination and therefore always
                    beats the computer.
